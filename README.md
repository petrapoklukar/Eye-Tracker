# Eye Tracker project

This was an internship project during my full-time master studies at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics 
in Ljubljana, Slovenia during academic years 2014/2015 and 2015/2016. The task was to learn the C# programming 
language while extending the basic functionality of a Tobii EyeX Eye Tracker. The uploaded program is a 
console application that opens a browser instance and collects points from the eyetracker until the URL
is changed. Once the URL changes it outputs a .JSON file containing (x, y)-coordinates of the points 
obtained from the eyetracker as well as a screenshot of the visited website with corresponding points drawn 
on it. The repository contains the following files:
* two .cs files containing the final code,
* a few examples of screenshots and corresponding .JSON files,
* the full report (in Slovene) of the progress and attained knowledge during the internship.

Special thanks to Franc Novak and Computer Systems Department at Institute of Jo≈æef Stefan for making this 
internship possible as well as to Rok Bajec who kindly helped me with C# and Visual Studio.
